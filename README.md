This is an experimental repository which aims are receiving mirrored github issues for the [CAPI pivotal tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/966314) stories.

The goal of such mirror is to help the Cf community track progress of the CF pivotal tracker stories (currently there is no way for non project members to subscribe to story updates, see related [cf-dev thread](http://cf-dev.70369.x6.nabble.com/cf-dev-FW-issue-tracker-permissions-tt2763.html#a5014) or https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues/560#issuecomment-156846815 where CLI team PM tried to add non-team members to provide ways to check story status), by leveraging github watch features to selectively subscribe to existing mirrored stories, or up-to-come future stories.

This is mirroring is automated using https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/pivotaltrackermirror Please notify of undesired side effects by submitting issues onto the pivotaltrackermirror repo.
